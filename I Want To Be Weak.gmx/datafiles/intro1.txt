[V:M]Once upon a time,[P:20]#the Realm of the Mortals faced grave danger.
A never before seen wicked force invaded and settled on Earth,#enslaving the Humans.
The Guardians,[P:20] immortal and most powerful beings that watch over #the three realms of the universe, [P:20]were reluctant to act
As they would be required to enter the Realm of the Mortals #themselves, [P:20]loosing their immortality.
They believed the Humans should find strength within them, [P:20]unite,[P:20]#and defeat the invaders themselves.
