[V:M]Hello my son! what brings you here to my chambers?
...[P:20] ...[P:20] ...[P:20]
What? you want to enter the realm of the mortals to help the Humans? #Nonsense!
It is too dangerous to go down there! [P:20]We become mortals while #in the Mortal Realm
Besides, [P:20]with our power we would possibly destroy Humanity #rather than save it
...[P:20]
You really have your mind made up haven't you? [P:20]#Fair enough. It's your choice
While I don't agree, [P:20]I'll stand by your decision #And I'll open the portal to the mortal realm
The mortals do not deserve this much! Keep this in mind
...
